# Yulu - Hypothesis Testing on Bike Rentals  

## Project Overview  
This project investigates factors influencing **Yulu e-bike rental demand** by analyzing the effects of **weather conditions, seasons, and holidays**. Using **hypothesis testing**, we assess whether these factors significantly impact bike rentals and develop insights for optimizing Yuluâ€™s operations.  

## Objectives  
- **Analyze** the impact of **temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions** on ride demand.  
- **Evaluate** how **holidays and working days** influence bike rentals.  
- **Validate insights using hypothesis testing** (t-tests, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-Square).  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **Statsmodels & Scipy (Hypothesis Testing: t-tests, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-Square)**  

## Key Insights  
- **Weather and seasonal changes** significantly impact rental demand.  
- **Working days and holidays** showed **no significant effect** on ride counts.  
- **Bike rentals increase in warmer seasons** and drop during extreme weather conditions.  
- The dataset showed **imbalanced distributions** for holidays, weather types, and working days.  

## Conclusion & Recommendations  
- Adjust **bike availability & pricing** based on weather conditions and seasonal demand.  
- Launch **seasonal promotions** to maximize engagement.  
- Offer **weather-based incentives** (e.g., discounts on rainy days) to boost off-peak demand.
